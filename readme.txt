== Description ==

This plugin gives you the ability to call the 404.php template file or your own custom template file for specific paths where a user is not logged into WordPress and is not a specific role.

To use Path Access look under the "Settings" menu.

Your theme must have a 404.php file. However, if you want a more custom page you can create a file called access.php and users will be directed to that template instead, this template will set you HTTP Response to 403.

In the User Interface, to restrict access to a page or child pages you must:

* Enter the path of that page
* Separate multiple paths with a return
* Include beginning and ending slashes "/"
* Add * to the end of a path to restrict all child pages.

You must have a 404.php template file or you can create your own template file and name it access.php. Some paths are blocked such as /wp-admin and /wp-login.php for your safety. You can also specify which roles may access the restricted pages by checking the boxes of the role you want to enable access for.
